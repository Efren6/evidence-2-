The topics covered during the class were a bit difficult to me because im not very familiarizied with them, and im not good. so in general the topics were challenging for me. Despite the fact that the topics were complicated, I consider that the teacher did his best to adapt them to the knowledge of the students and make the class more comprehensive and simple. One point that caught my attention in class was the subject of forecasts and the utility they have in companies. I am grateful that the teacher took time during the course to clearly explain to us the topics that we were not familiar with.I think it was a key factor for me to have a better performance in the class.
